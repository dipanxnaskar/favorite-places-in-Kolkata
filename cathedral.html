      St. Paul’s Cathedral is one of the most beautiful and historic churches in Kolkata, located near the Victoria Memorial. 
      Built in 1847, it was the first Episcopal Cathedral Church in the eastern part of the world. 
      The cathedral’s design follows Indo-Gothic architecture, with tall spires, stained glass windows, and a stunning high altar. <br><br>
      Inside, the peaceful ambiance, intricate carvings, and memorial tablets reflect the colonial heritage of the city. 
      The church becomes especially charming during Christmas when it is beautifully decorated and illuminated. 
      St. Paul’s Cathedral is not only a place of worship but also a symbol of Kolkata’s spiritual and architectural grandeur.
