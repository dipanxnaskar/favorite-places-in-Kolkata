      The Victoria Memorial is one of Kolkata’s most iconic landmarks, built between 1906 and 1921 in memory of Queen Victoria. 
      Designed by Sir William Emerson, this grand white marble monument is a blend of British and Mughal architectural styles. 
      It stands as a symbol of the city’s colonial past, surrounded by lush green gardens and a large water body that beautifully reflects its structure. <br><br>
      Inside the memorial is a museum housing over 3,000 exhibits, including rare paintings, sculptures, manuscripts, and artifacts from the British era. 
      The evening light and sound show narrating Kolkata’s history is a must-see for visitors. Whether you visit during the day or night, 
      the Victoria Memorial remains a timeless beauty that captures the soul of Kolkata.
