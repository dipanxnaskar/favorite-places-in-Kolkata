      The Zoological Garden, Alipore—popularly known as Alipore Zoo—is one of Kolkata’s most loved attractions and the oldest zoo in India, established in 1876. 
      Spread over 46 acres, the zoo is home to a wide variety of animals, birds, and reptiles from around the world. 
      It was once home to the famous Aldabra giant tortoise, Adwaita, believed to have lived for more than 250 years. <br><br>
      Visitors can see majestic lions, tigers, elephants, giraffes, and colorful exotic birds. 
      The zoo’s landscaped gardens, walkways, and lakes make it a perfect place for families, students, and nature lovers. 
      During winter, it becomes one of the busiest and most cheerful spots in Kolkata.
